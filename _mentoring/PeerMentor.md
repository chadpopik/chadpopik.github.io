This program seeks to facilitate the transition of graduate students new to the Astronomy Department into the departmental community and to create a support and advocacy system for graduate studentsâ€™ development and success. Mentors will be expected to sign two contracts: one outlining their responsibilities, which include attending training sessions, and another outlining the goals for the mentoring relationship which will be completed with the mentee.
