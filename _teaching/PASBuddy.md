Additionally, we are planning on matching each incoming student with an upperclassmen buddy.  This buddy will reach out to you over summer to tell you a little bit more about their college experience and what it's like to be a physics major.  You'll be able to chat with them, ask questions, and have a friendly face to turn to once you're on campus.
