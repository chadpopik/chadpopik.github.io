Peer advisors share their academic experiences with classmates, provide preliminary academic program planning information, encourage students to consider independent study, research and/or study abroad opportunities, and connect students with faculty within their specific academic departments. Additionally, peer advisors attend special programs where their assistance is helpful--e.g., "How to Declare Your Major" workshops and First-Year Orientation. A one-credit, 6-week course called "Peer Mentoring and Advising" is mandatory for applicants as part of training for the Peer Advisor position. The intention of this course is to provide the information, skills, and training necessary to be a successful Peer Advisor, mentor, and leader.
