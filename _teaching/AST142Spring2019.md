Responsbilities included leading weekly coding-based workshops, supervising student use of the C.E.K. Mees Observatory, holding weekly office hours, and grading assignments and exams.

Syllabus: Application of the physics and math techniques learned in the introductory course sequences, to the study of celestial objects outside the Solar system. We discuss stars and their formation from interstellar matter, the structure of galaxies and their distribution in the Universe, and the origins and large-scale structure of the Universe: all topics that are developed much further in the ASTR 200-level courses. The course also includes a night-time observing project, based upon student use of professional-style telescopes and CCD cameras. Typical textbook: Marck Kutner, 'Astronomy' A Physical Perspective,' second edition.
